1.Stock-Outs / Lost Sales

By forecasting demand and setting reorder points, you prevent situations where popular SKUs run out, protecting revenue and customer satisfaction.

2.Excess Inventory / High Holding Costs

Reduces overstocking of slow-moving SKUs, lowering storage costs and minimizing waste.

3.Inefficient Resource Allocation

Prioritizes attention and investment toward high-revenue SKUs (Category A) rather than spreading resources thin.

4.Poor Decision-Making Due to Lack of Data

Provides data-driven insights through dashboards and reports for inventory planning, reducing guesswork.

5.Supplier & Lead Time Challenges

Identifies slow or unreliable suppliers and SKUs with long lead times, enabling corrective actions like alternate sourcing or buffer stock.

6.Seasonal & Trend Misalignment

Detects changes in demand trends early, allowing the business to adjust orders, promotions, or production schedules proactively.
